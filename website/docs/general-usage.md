Caravaggio accept the input image to transform and the transformation to apply.

<code>http&#8203;:&#8203;//caravaggio.now.sh/<strong>q_90,o_webp</strong>/https&#8203;:&#8203;//image.com/landscape.png</code>

In this case the image reachable at `https://image.com/landscape.png` will be rotated of **`90° clockwise`** and the result will be in the **`webp`** format.

In general each transformation is expressed in the form **`transformation_parameter`** and can be separated
by the next through a comma **`,`**

The url instead, **`https://image.com/landscape.png`** is simply a fully qualifid address of the image to fetch and transform.

## Live examples ⚠️

Most of the examples in this documentation have a link to a test deploy of Caravaggio. The server is not intended for production use and when a certain bandwith limit 
is reached it becomes unavailable or slow. We do this to prevent people using it as their conversion machine. Please be kind using it... 😏
Also, tiff format is not available.

## Complex urls

If the url of the image to transform contains query parameters, you must encode it.    
In example, the url `https://image.com/landscape.png?user=joe` must be sent as

<code>https&#8203;:&#8203;//caravaggio.now.sh/q_90/https%3A%2F%2Fimage.com%2Flandscape.png%3Fuser%3Djoe</code>

or at least

<code>https&#8203;:&#8203;//caravaggio.now.sh/q_90/https&#8203;:&#8203;//image.com/landscape.png%3Fuser%3Djoe</code>

In javascript, to obtain this encoding you can run

```js
const url = 'https://image.com/landscape.png?user=joe';
const encoded = encodeURIComponent(uri);
const caravaggioUrl = `https://caravaggio.now.sh/q_90/${encoded}`;
```

Use similar functions in the language of your choice, they are the same functions used to encode query parameters.
